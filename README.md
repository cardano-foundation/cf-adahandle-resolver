This project aims to provide a scoped indexer for retrieving ADA Handle information from the Cardano blockchain and exposing it via REST using [Yaci Store](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store).

## Why ADA Handle resolver?
One may ask why Ada Handle resolve if there is already: https://github.com/koralabs/handles-public-api

Ada Handler resolver by CF differentiates itself with a number of following traits:
- it demostrates usage of Yaci-Store modular indexer
- is written in Java, thus easier extendable and to easier to reason about by Java Developers
- doesn't have any dependencies to other components, e.g. Ogmios, blockfrost, etc
- handles db has very small on disk footprint
- supports embedded DBs such as H2 for easier deployment

## ü§ñ API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                                         | Description                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| http://localhost:9095/swagger-ui.html                            | **Swagger UI** for the API endpoints                    |
| http://localhost:9095/api/v1/ada-handles/by-stake-address        | [GET]s the ADA Handle held by a given stake address     |
| http://localhost:9095/api/v1/ada-handles/by-payment-address      | [GET]s the ADA Handle held by a given payment address   |
| http://localhost:9095/api/v1/addresses/by-ada-handle/{adaHandle} | [GET]s the stake and payment addresses behind a provided ADA Handle   |
| http://localhost:9095/api/v1/ada-handles/by-payment-address      | [GET]s the payment address behind a provided ADA Handle |

## üëª Disable Indexer

If you intend to scale this service, running multiple instances of the API is advisable. 
However, you may not want a crawl job on every instance. To disable the indexer (yaci-store), 
utilize the `disable-indexer` profile as an environment variable.

```zsh
SPRING_ACTIVE_PROFILES=disable-indexer java -jar target/cf-adahandle-resolver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## üå± Environment Variables

Possible profiles: `mainnet`, `preprod`, `preview`, `local-node`, `h2`, `disable-indexer`
